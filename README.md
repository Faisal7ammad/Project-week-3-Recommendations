## Project Description
This project aims to create a feature that recomends songs based on a user query.

## Questions & Hypotheses
How can we predict a similar song based on just one input from the user > user input = song name

## Dataset
Using 3 data sets: 
    - Data from Spotify API
    - Webscraping Billboards 100
    - Data from our module

## Database
Database is made of mainly dataframes and lists.

## Workflow
 - Data wrangling and analysis
 - Creating module
 - Coding feature

## Organization
The repo includes:
 - The recomender noteboook that creates dataframes and the feature code.
 - the module notebook that clusters songs in preperation for prediction.
 - a pickle from with trained module that can be used in the recomender notebook
 - please note that you need to set up your spotipy config file to use this code.
 - Presentation Video
